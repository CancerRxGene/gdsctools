Set of JINJA templates. 

This is probably naive but it helps to create the HTML reports.
There is place for improvments but here is the layout


* base is the parent class that holds the footer/header. It is inherited by all
  other templates here below
* index is the template for the main index.html page. Used in HTMLPageMain
* drug and feature are the template used in HTMLOneDrug and HTMLOneFeature
* manova is the template used to create the manova.html page in HTMLPageMANOVA
