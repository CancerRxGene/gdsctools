About the Copyright Holders
===============================

Version 1.0 of GDSCTools was originally developed by Thomas Cokelaer 
(based on an original work from Francesco Iorio; see 
https://github.com/francescojm/FI.GDSC.ANOVA) and the help of the 
GDSCTools Developement Team.

The GDSCTools Developement Team is the collection of developers that
contributed to the development of GDSCTools, which includes code and
documentation. 

Full credits for GDSCTools Developement Team can be found in the 
documentation or source code.

GDSCTools uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to GDSCTools. However, it is important to note that
these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the GDSCTools source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire GDSCTools Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
when they commit the change to one of the GDSCTools repositories.
With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code
file to indicate the copyright and license terms:
