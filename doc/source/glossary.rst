    IC50
        The IC50 is the half maximal Inhibitory Concentration that is a 
        measure of effectiveness of a drug or substance in inhibiting 
        a specific biological or biochemical function.

        Sometimes, IC50 values are converted to the pIC50 scale that is 
        :math:`-\log10 (IC50)`.

        pIC50 is usually given in terms of molar concentration (mol/L or M). 
        Therefore to obtain pIC50, an IC50 should be specified in units 
        of M. When IC50 is expressed in microM or nanoM, it will need to 
        be converted to M before conversion to pIC50.


    EC50

        The EC50 is the half maximal Effective Concentration and refers to the
        concentration of a drug, antibody or toxicant which induces a 
        response halfway between the baseline and maximum after a specified 
        amount of time. It is used as a measure of drug's potency

    MSI, Microsatellite Instability

        Markers indicating presence or absence of a MSI shift, allele
        homozygosity/heterozygosity, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) observed
        in the tumor sample for each participant
