Reproducibility
#########################

In this section we show how to reproduce some specific results produced in the
context of GDSC1000 paper for example. 

The motivation for this section is to show that results can be reproduced IF the
proper parameter are set.

Data sets used for real data analysis are tagged as vXY and we start with an
example on v17 data
