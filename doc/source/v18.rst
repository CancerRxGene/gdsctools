Notes about v18
====================

In V18, the IC50 may have duplicated columns for a given drug. Some drugs are
clustered together. The algorithm was implemented in GDSCTools in IC50Cluster
class. It should used as follow::

IC50 must be read with the IC50Cluster class as follows::

    from gdsctools import *
    ic50 = IC50Cluster("v18_data")
    ic50.cleanup()

This will ensure alos that the drug identifiers are unique. Indeed, 
in v18 data sets, columns for a given DRUG ID may be duplicated 
(for different drug concentration).

Then, as usual::

    an = ANOVA(ic50, "GF.csv", "DRUG_DECODE.csv")

All default parameters were used except for the FDR threshold::

    report.settings.FDR_threshold = 35
