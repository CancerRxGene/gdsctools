Notebooks
==========

Within **GDSCTools**, we also provide a set of `IPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_. Those notebooks are like recipes and tutorials and reproduce some of the examples available in this documentation. We encourage you to have a look at the IPython and IPython notebook online documentation if you want to create your own notebooks.

.. note:: IPython is a growing project, with increasingly language-agnostic components. As of IPython 4.0, the language-agnostic parts of the project (e.g., notebook) have moved to new projects under the name `Jupyter <jupyter.org>`_.


The original notebooks that we provide in **GDSCTools** are available in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CancerRxGene/gdsctools/tree/master/notebooks>`_ and can visualised via the `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CancerRxGene/gdsctools/tree/master/notebooks/>`_.

Note, however, that to get the best of the those notebooks (interactivity), you
should try them locally:

    - install gdsctools and IPython if not already done. 
    - If you installed from source, the notebooks are in ./gdsctools/notebooks,
      otherwise, download the notebooks from the `online repository <https://github.com/CancerRxGene/gdsctools/tree/master/notebooks>`_.
    - Go in the directory where are located the notebooks and type (in a shell)::

        ipython notebook

      This should start the interactive notebook in a browser and you should see
      the notebooks. Click on one of them and go through the notebooks. 


The notebooks cover many different aspects of the **GDSCTools** library including the quickstart discussed in this documentation. We will not give more details about their contents since they may evolve and change we time. We encourage you to create new ones and to share them.
