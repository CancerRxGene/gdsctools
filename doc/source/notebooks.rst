Notebooks
==========

**GDSCTools** being written in Python, we also provide a set of `IPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_. Those notebooks are like recipes and tutorials. We encourage you to have a look at the IPython online documentation if you want to create your own notebooks.

.. note:: IPython is a growing project, with increasingly language-agnostic components. As of IPython 4.0, the language-agnostic parts of the project (e.g., notebook) have moved to new projects under the name `Jupyter <jupyter.org>`_.


The original notebooks that we provide in **GDSCTools** are available in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CancerRxGene/gdsctools/tree/master/notebooks>`_ and can easily browsed and downloaded via the `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/CancerRxGene/gdsctools/tree/master/notebooks/>`_.

They cover the different aspects of the GDSCTools library that are discussed in
this documentation. We will not give more details about their contents and we
let the readers explore those notebooks. We encourage you to create new ones and
to share them.
